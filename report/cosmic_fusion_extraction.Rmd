Extract Gene Partners and Analyze Pairings
========================================================

Getting Data
--------------------------------------------------------
The data is found on the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC):

> http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/files?data=/files/grch38/cosmic/v76/CosmicFusionExport.tsv.gz

A user must register at http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/register before downloading.

File Description:

```
Sample name, Sample id, Id tumour - A sample is an instance of a portion of a tumour being examined for mutations. The sample name can be derived from a number of sources. In many cases it originates from the cell line name. Other sources include names assigned by the annotators, or an incremented number assigned during an anonymisation process. A number of samples can be taken from a single tumour and a number of tumours can be obtained from one individual. A sample id is used to identify a sample within the COSMIC database. There can be multiple ids, if the same sample has been entered into the database multiple times from different papers.

Primary Site - The primary tissue/cancer from which the sample originated. More details on the tissue classification can be found here In COSMIC we have standard set of classification system for tissue types and sub types because they vary a lot between different papers.

Site Subtype 1 - Further sub classification (level 1) of the samples tissue of origin.

Site Subtype 2 - Further sub classification (level 2) of the samples tissue of origin.

Site Subtype 3 - Further sub classification (level 3) of the samples tissue of origin.

Primary Histology - The histological classification of the sample.

Histology Subtype 1- Further histological classification (level 1) of the sample.

Histology Subtype 2- Further histological classification (level 2) of the sample.

Histology Subtype 3- Further histological classification (level 3) of the sample.

Fusion Id - unique fusion mutation identifier

Translocation Name - - Syntax describing the portions of mRNA present (in HGVS "r." format) from each gene (allows representation of UTR sequences).

Fusion type - Type of mutation :

   Inferred breakpoint - Inferred breakpoints are the genomic breakpoints when the literature reports more than one transcript per sample, implying significant alternative splicing of the mRNAs expressed from the fused gene pair or observed mRNA).

Pubmed_PMID - The PUBMED ID for the paper that the sample was noted in.

Id Study - Lists the unique Ids of studies that have involved this fusion mutation.
```

Once the data has been downloaded and uncompressed, the file you get is in a
tab-separated format but R works better in comma-separated formatted files.

```
$ cat CosmicFusionExport.tsv | tr '\t' ',' > CosmicFusionExport.csv
```

Load Fusion Data
--------------------------------------------------------
This analysis is meant to extract the gene pairings from the cosmicFusion data frame. Here is a snipet of the raw data:

```{r loadFusionData, cache=TRUE}
# change the name of the file as necessary
cosmicFusion <- read.csv("../data/CosmicFusionExport.csv",
                         header=TRUE,
                         row.names=NULL)

head(cosmicFusion) # see a sample of what the data looks like
dim(cosmicFusion) # see how large the dataset
```

Goal
--------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this document is to extract only the gene fusion pairings into a single data frame with the first column being the 5' gene partner and the second column be the 3' gene partner. Another element we must take into account is the "Fusion.Type." The Fusion.Type for each gene fusion is either "Observed mRNA" or "Inferred Breakpoint." We will focus on the "Observed mRNA" reasons to make the analysis easier.

Focus on Description Data
--------------------------------------------------------
We know that we need to focus on the "Translocation.Name" and "Fusion.Type" columns so we shall save it in another data frame.

```{r resaveData}
fusionDescription <- cosmicFusion[,12:13] # save Descriptions and Reason
head(fusionDescription) # show beginning of new data frame
```

Remove Empty Cells
--------------------------------------------------------
There are many empty spaces in between the data we want. Let us remove these
spaces and keep only the cells with information in them.

```{r removeEmpty}
dim(fusionDescription)[1] # number of fusions at this step
fusionDescription <- fusionDescription[fusionDescription[,1] != "", ] # remove spaces
Description <- as.character(fusionDescription[ ,1]) # to change descriptions
Reason <- as.character(fusionDescription[ ,2]) # to change reasons
rawFusions <- cbind(Description, Reason) # put them together
rawFusions <- rawFusions[ ,1] # keep just the descriptions
head(rawFusions)
length(rawFusions) # number of fusions left
```

Note on Inferred Breakpoint/Observed mRNA
--------------------------------------------------------
In the data source, there are two categories for the genes: inferred breakpoint
or observed mRNA. The difference between the two are highlighted on the COSMIC
website.

Inferred breakpoints are when the literature reports more than one transcript
per sample, implying that there are multiple variants. The observed mRNA are
determined from experimental measures.

Because they are still valid variants of the sequences, we have decided to keep
them in the analysis.

Plan to Convert Single-line Elements to Data Frame
--------------------------------------------------------
Now that we have only the elements we need, we can proceed in separating the
relavent data in the array we created.

The general structure of the Translocation.Name is:

> 5GENE{ID}:r.BEGIN_END_3GENE{ID}:r.BEGIN_END

There are also cases where there is no information of where the breakpoints are,
so we need to take those into account as well. Those will look like this:

> 5GENE{ID}:r.?_3GENE{ID}:r.?

We will not consider those cases with unknown breakpoints, inverted genes,
insertions, or complex/multiple fusion partners.

To separate the string, we need to consider multiple characters:

- keep the 5' and 3' gene name
- remove ID between the both sets of brackets
- keep the breakpoints for 5' and 3' gene
- ignore inverted genes (there is an 'o' character in front of the 3' gene)
- ignore the complex gene fusions with multiple partners
- ignore breakpoints in intron regions (marked with '+' and '-' signs)
- ignore fusions with unknown breakpoints (labeled with a question mark in the
  breakpoint syntax)

Remove Duplicates
--------------------------------------------------------
```{r removeDuplicates}
# remove duplicates before doing anything else
head(rawFusions)
length(rawFusions)
uniqueFusions <- rawFusions[!duplicated(rawFusions)]
head(uniqueFusions)
length(uniqueFusions) # number of fusions now
```

Counting Total Number of Gene Pairs
--------------------------------------------------------
Before going any further, I will count how many pairs there are in all the
fusions before messing with the data. This will tell us the absolute difference
between the number of gene pairs we had originally and the pairs we ended up
with after cleaning up the data. This also provides feedback on if there are
some fusions we should keep or if the consideration of more complex cases does
not matter.

```{r countTotalPairs}

```

Remove Unknown Breakpoints
--------------------------------------------------------
```{r unknownBreakpoints}
uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions <- grep("\\?",
                                    uniqueFusions,
                                    value=TRUE,
                                    invert=TRUE)
head(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions)
length(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions) # number of fusions now
```

Remove Insertions
--------------------------------------------------------
There are some gene fusions that have inserted genetic sequences. Let us remove
them for simplicity.

We have not separated the fusions between simple and complex so this subset of
the data with insertions will contain both simple and complex fusions.

```{r removeInsertions}
# save insertions in another matrix
insertions <- grep("_ins",
                   uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions,
                   value=TRUE)
head(insertions) # sample of insertions
length(insertions) # how many insertions

# remove insertions
uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions <- grep("_ins",
                                     uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions,
                                     value=TRUE,
                                     invert=TRUE) # keep non-insertions
head(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions)
length(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions) # number of fusions now
```

Remove Intronic Breakpoints
--------------------------------------------------------
We will remove the fusions with breakpoints with upstream and downstream
breakpoints, as indicated with `+` and `-` signs. This will simplify parsing.
In the future, these can be added back in to get a more complete picture, but
for now we can remove them.

```{r removeDownUpBreakpoints}
uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions <- grep("\\+",
               uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions,
               value = TRUE,
               invert = TRUE)
uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions <- grep("\\-",
                    uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions,
                    value = TRUE,
                    invert = TRUE)
length(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions)
```

Remove Inverted Fusions
--------------------------------------------------------
There are some fusions that have inverted elements in them. We wish to ignore
those cases for now. These fusions with inverted elements are labeled with an
"o" before the gene name, like before the second gene here:

> FUS{ENST00000254108}:r.1_628_oCREB3L2{ENST00000330387}:r.972_984_CREB3L2{ENST00000330387}:r.1006_7412

```{r removeInverted}
uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions <- grep("_o",
                                     uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions,
                                     value = TRUE,
                                     invert = TRUE)
length(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions)
```

Discern Complex Gene Fusions from Simple Ones
--------------------------------------------------------
The fusions we want are the ones involving pairs of genes. To make the analysis
easier, we will put the fusions into two categories: complex and simple. The
simple ones have just a pair of genes and nothing too complicated in the syntax.
The complicated case might involve only two genes in the fusion but has been
combined more than once. We will consider these but right now, we will complete
one step at a time, namely separate the simple from the complicated cases.

```{r complexFusions}
library("stringr") # load appropriate package first

allSizes <- str_locate_all(uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions, ":")
n <- length(allSizes)
nArray <- array(data = NA, dim = n) # T/F array

for (i in 1:n) { # loop through all elements
    if (dim(allSizes[[i]])[1] > 2) { # if gene fusion is complex
        nArray[i] <- FALSE # don't include it
        next
    } else {
        nArray[i] <- TRUE # include it otherwise
    }
}
# simple cases
simpleUniqueFusions <- uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions[nArray]

# complex cases
complexUniqueFusions <- uniqueKnownBreakpointFusions[!nArray]

# summary of simple
head(simpleUniqueFusions)
length(simpleUniqueFusions) # the number of simple gene fusions so far

# summary of complex
head(complexUniqueFusions)
length(complexUniqueFusions)
```

Separate Simple Elements
--------------------------------------------------------
We want to separate the elements into 6 columns.

> 5' gene | ID | 5' start | 5' end | 3' gene | ID | 3' start | 3' end

The start and end numbers are the breakpoints. At the same time, we want to
preserve the Ensembl ID numbers for future use.

```{r separateElements}
#  make empty matrix to put new data into
columns <- 8 # number of columns based on the syntax above
rows <- length(simpleUniqueFusions) # number of fusions we're working with
newDescription <- matrix(ncol=columns, nrow=rows) # create matrix we will us

# separate string out using substitution
for (i in 1: rows) {
    pattern <- "(.+){(.+)}:r.([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)_(.+){(.+)}:r.([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)"
    newDescription[i,1] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\1", # want the first set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,2] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\2", # want the second set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,3] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\3", # want the third set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,4] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\4", # want the fourth set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,5] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\5", # want the fifth set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,6] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\6", # want the sixth set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,7] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\7", # want the seventh set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    newDescription[i,8] <- sub(pattern,
            "\\8", # want the eighth set of parentheses
            simpleUniqueFusions[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
}

head(newDescription) # sample of the fusions
dim(newDescription)[1] # how many fusions do we have

# data exploration
write.table(newDescription, "../results/newDescription.txt")
```

Unique Simple Gene Pairings
--------------------------------------------------------
We have all the unique gene fusions but we do not have all the unique gene
fusion pairings. Let us see how many unique gene pairings we have.

```{r uniquePairings}
simplePairings <- cbind(newDescription[, 1], # 5' gene
                        newDescription[, 5]) # 3' gene
uniquePairings <- simplePairings[!duplicated(simplePairings), ]
head(uniquePairings) # sample what we have
dim(uniquePairings)[1] # number of simple unique gene fusion pairs
```

Dealing with Complex Cases
--------------------------------------------------------
Here we will deal with the complex cases that were saved from earlier. Here we
will only consider pairs of complex gene fusions. The plan is to parse through
each fusion and count the number of genes in each case. If there are more than
two genes in a single gene fusion, then it will not be counted.

Because of how the string processing function in R works, I will still need to
separate the complex gene fusions a little bit.

Count Number of Genes in Complex Cases
--------------------------------------------------------
The way the string functions work in R as of now force me to count the number of
genes in the fusion before moving on to see if there exist a pairing or a group
of genes.

```{r countGenes}
length(complexUniqueFusions) # need this number to double check out totals
allSizesAgain <- str_locate_all(complexUniqueFusions, ":")
n <- length(allSizesAgain)
nArray <- array(data = NA, dim = n) # T/F array

for (i in 1:n) { # loop through all elements
    if (dim(allSizesAgain[[i]])[1] == 4) { # if gene fusion has more than 3 parts
        nArray[i] <- FALSE # reclassify it
        next
    }
    if (dim(allSizesAgain[[i]])[1] == 3) {
        nArray[i] <- TRUE # know that it comprises of three groups
    }
}

# fusion with three parts
threeFusionsRaw <- complexUniqueFusions[nArray] # complex fusions w/ 3 parts
length(threeFusionsRaw) # number of fusions with three parts
head(threeFusionsRaw) # a peek at the data

# fusion with more than three parts
fourFusions <- complexUniqueFusions[!nArray] # complex fusions w/ >3 parts
length(fourFusions) # number of fusions with four parts
head(fourFusions) # sampling of the fusions with four parts
```

After separating the dataset into fusions with three parts and another only with
four parts, we still have the correct total. Thus, there are no gene fusions in
our dataset that have more than four parts together we have to worry about.

Remove Breakpoints with Parentheses
--------------------------------------------------------
Upon looking at some of the fusions with three components, there are some with
parentheses in the breakpoint regions. I cannot find out what this information
means yet. I can only guess that this means that those breakpoints are not
certain. Some of them are ranges:

> `r threeFusionsRaw[9]`.

Others are just enclosed in parentheses:

> `r threeFusionsRaw[13]`.

```{r saveParentheses}
nArray <- array(data = NA, dim = length(threeFusionsRaw)) # get T/F array
parenFusions <- grep("\\(", threeFusionsRaw, value=TRUE) # save paren fusions
head(parenFusions) # let's take a look
length(parenFusions) # how many parentheses fusions do we have
```

Now we will save the normal fusions without the parerntheses.

```{r removeParentheses}
threeFusionsRaw <- grep("\\(", threeFusionsRaw, value=TRUE, invert=TRUE)
head(threeFusionsRaw) # see if the data looks right
length(threeFusionsRaw) # how many do we have left
```

Separate Complex Gene Fusion Strings and Filter Pairs with Three Genes
--------------------------------------------------------
```{r pairGeneFusionsThree}
head(threeFusionsRaw) # see a bit of the data
length(threeFusionsRaw) # see how many three gene'd fusions we have
nArray <- array(data = NA, dim = length(threeFusionsRaw)) # TRUE/FALSE array
pairsMatrix <- c(); # empty

otherPairs <- c();
for (i in 1:length(threeFusionsRaw)) {
    pattern <- "(.+){(.+)}:r\\.([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)_(.+){(.+)}:r\\.([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)_.+{.+}:r\\.[0-9]+_[0-9]+"

    # first gene information
    first <- sub(pattern,
            "\\1", # want the first set of parentheses
            threeFusionsRaw[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    firstID <- sub(pattern, "\\2", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    firstStart <- sub(pattern, "\\3", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    firstEnd <- sub(pattern, "\\4", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)

    # second gene information
    second <- sub(pattern,
            "\\5", # want the second set of parentheses
            threeFusionsRaw[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    secondID <- sub(pattern, "\\6", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    secondStart <- sub(pattern, "\\7", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    secondEnd <- sub(pattern, "\\8", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)

    # regex does not allow more than nine groups, so I gotta redefine the
    # pattern so that I can extract the rest of the information
    pattern <- ".+{.+}:r\\.[0-9]+_[0-9]+_.+{.+}:r\\.[0-9]+_[0-9]+_(.+){(.+)}:r\\.([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)"

    # three gene information
    third <- sub(pattern,
            "\\1", # want the third set of parentheses
            threeFusionsRaw[i], # the string to use
            perl = TRUE # use Perl regex
        )
    thirdID <- sub(pattern, "\\2", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    thirdStart <- sub(pattern, "\\3", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)
    thirdEnd <- sub(pattern, "\\4", threeFusionsRaw[i], perl = TRUE)

    # put information together
    otherPairs <- rbind(otherPairs,
                        c(first, firstID, firstStart, firstEnd,
                          second, secondID, secondStart, secondEnd,
                          third, thirdID, thirdStart, thirdEnd),
                        deparse.level=0)

    # figure out if pairing or not
    if (sum(duplicated(c(first, second, third))) == 1) {
        nArray[i] <- TRUE # keep
        allThree <- c(first, second, third) # put all three together
        uniqueThreePairs <- allThree[!duplicated(allThree)] # find unique pair

        # make pairs matrix
        pairsMatrix <- rbind(pairsMatrix,
                             uniqueThreePairs,
                             deparse.level = 0)
    } else {
        nArray[i] <- FALSE # do not keep
    }
}

# only keep pairs
otherPairs <- otherPairs[nArray,]
head(otherPairs) # did we filter and separate correctly

# get gene pairings
head(pairsMatrix)
dim(pairsMatrix)[1] # number of three part fusions
```

Separate Complex Gene Fusion Strings and Filter Pairs with Four Genes
--------------------------------------------------------
There is only one gene fusion that has made it thus far in the filtering so we
can separate the string personally on this one string.

If the above filtering process changes, this part may need to be revised to
accommodate the number of strings to parse.

```{r pairGeneFusionsFour}
initSeparate <- str_extract_all(string = fourFusions,
                               pattern = "[^\\.:\\{r\\_\\}]+")
initSeparate <- initSeparate[[1]]
initSeparate # see what we got
fourPair <- c(initSeparate[1], initSeparate[9]) # the two genes in the fusion
pairsMatrix <- rbind(pairsMatrix,
                     fourPair)

# check data
tail(pairsMatrix) # note the addition to the end of the pairs matrix
dim(pairsMatrix)[1] # number of complex pairs
```

Complete Unique Pairings
--------------------------------------------------------
Here we need to put all three datasets back together and then run the uniqueness
algorithm on it to find the complete list of unique gene pairings in the gene
fusions in our dataset.

```{r compileData}
allPairsRaw <- rbind(uniquePairings,
                  pairsMatrix,
                  deparse.level = 0 # no labels
                  )
allUniquePairs <- allPairsRaw[!duplicated(allPairsRaw), ]
head(allUniquePairs) # sample unique pairs data
dim(allUniquePairs)[1] # how many unique pairs
```

Load and Discuss Ensembl Genome Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------
We have decided to stick with the Ensembl genome set to map to the COSMIC data
so we can figure out the mechanism for each gene fusion.

Each gene fusion can occur among three different mechanisms:

- a strongly expressed promotor of one gene being fused with a second gene, thus
  the second gene being expressed more
- a conjoining between the 5'-most end of a gene with the 3'-more end of a
  second gene
- "the fusion results in the truncation or loss of function of a tumor
  suppressor gene"

We want to focus on the second case of two functional pieces of genes are fused
instead of a gain or loss of function, in the case of the other two choices.

```{r loadEnsemblData, cache=TRUE}
ensemblData <- read.csv(file = "../raw-data/ensembl_GRCh37_2014.08.29.csv",
                        header = TRUE)
head(ensemblData) # the top of the data
dim(ensemblData)[1] # how many entries we have
```

Now that we have the data in R, we can mess around with it. What we really need
from this dataset is the Ensembl trascript ID (because this is what is in the
COSMIC file to uniquely identify each component of the fusion), and the 5' UTR
start and end points.

The COSMIC dataset gives me the breakpoints of the 5' gene. To figure out the
mechanism, I need to get the 5' breakpoint and compare that to the difference
in the 5' UTR start and end points. If the 5' breakpoint of the 5' gene in the
fusion is less than the difference in the UTR start and end, then the gene
fusion is a strong promoter gene fusion, which we do not want.

Filter and Save Fusions with Non-Ensembl ID (Two Part Fusions)
--------------------------------------------------------
Looking at the dataset, we can observe some fusions with non-Ensembl IDs. These
IDs are from NCBI. It will be more complicated to take these into account for
now so we will filter them out and save them for later use.

Here we will filter and save fusions with two parts. Three and four part fusions
will be handled in the proceeding sections.

```{r nonEnsemblIDTwoGenes}
# filter those with underscores for five prime gene, will fix later
enID <- grep("ENST",
            newDescription[,2],
            invert = FALSE)
nonEnID <- grep("ENST",
                newDescription[,2],
                invert = TRUE)

# save non-Ensembl ID fusions
newDescriptionNonEnID <- newDescription[nonEnID,]
dim(newDescriptionNonEnID)[1] # how many non-Ensembl fusions

# save Ensembl ID fusions
newDescription <- newDescription[enID,]
dim(newDescription)[1] # how many Ensembl fusions in first gene

# add in filtered three prime genes as well
enID <- grep("ENST",
             newDescription[,6],
             invert = FALSE)
nonEnID <- grep("ENST",
                newDescription[,6],
                invert = TRUE)

Filter and Save Fusions with Non-Ensembl ID (Three Part Fusions)
--------------------------------------------------------
Here we will perform the algorithm as mentioned above, except we will deal with
three part fusions.

```{r nonEnsemblIDThreeGenes}
# filter first gene part
enID <- grep("ENST",
            otherPairs[,2],
            invert = FALSE)
nonEnID <- grep("ENST",
                otherPairs[,2],
                invert = TRUE)

# save non-Ensembl ID fusions
otherPairsNonEnID <- otherPairs[nonEnID,]
dim(otherPairsNonEnID)[1] # number of non-Ensembl fusions

# save Ensembl ID fusions
otherPairs <- otherPairs[enID,]
dim(otherPairs)[1] # number of Ensembl ID'd fusions

# filter second gene for non-Ensembl IDs
enID <- grep("ENST",
             otherPairs[,6],
             invert = FALSE)
nonEnID <- grep("ENST",
                otherPairs[,6],
                invert = TRUE)

# save second non-Ensembl ID fusions
otherPairsNonEnID <- rbind(otherPairsNonEnID,
                           otherPairs[nonEnID,])
dim(otherPairsNonEnID)[1]

# save Ensembl ID Fusions
otherPairs <- otherPairs[enID,]
dim(otherPairs)[1]

# filter third gene for non-Ensembl IDs
enID <- grep("ENST",
             otherPairs[ ,10],
             invert = FALSE)
nonEnID <- grep("ENST",
                otherPairs[ ,10],
                invert = TRUE)

# save third non-Ensembl ID fusions
otherPairsNonEnID <- rbind(otherPairsNonEnID,
                               otherPairs[nonEnID,])
head(otherPairsNonEnID)
dim(otherPairsNonEnID)[1] # how many three part fusions we have w/o Ensembl IDs

# save Ensembl ID in fusions with three parts
otherPairs <- otherPairs[enID, ]
head(otherPairs)
dim(otherPairs)[1] # how many three part fusions we have
```

Plan on Determining Mechanism
--------------------------------------------------------
We need to figure out if the fusions we have at this point have any UTR parts as
the sole 5' or 3' gene in the fusion. To do this we will focus on the 5' UTR and
the 3' UTR points of the Ensembl data.

The 5' gene case is a bit simpler. Manual looking at the data, all the 5' gene
partners start at the beginning of the gene and have a breakpoint downstream. So
all we need to check is if the downstream breakpoint is greater than the length
of the 5' UTR, which we will need to calculate.

The 3' gene case is a bit more difficult. We will first need to calculate the
total length of the gene to figure out if the gene partner actually goes to the
end of the gene. Once we confirm this, we can then add up the 3' UTR lengths and
compare it with the breakpoint length given.

Mechanism of Two Part Fusions
--------------------------------------------------------
```{r mechanism, cache=TRUE}
nArray <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = dim(newDescription)[1], ncol = 4)

for (i in 1:dim(newDescription)[1]) { # loop through all fusions
    ## get 5' gene partner and UTR information
    fiveGeneIn2 <- newDescription[i,2] # get Ensembl ID for 5' gene
    focusGene5 <- ensemblData[ensemblData$Ensembl_Transcript_ID == fiveGeneIn2,]
    focusUTR5 <- focusGene5[!is.na(focusGene5$X5_UTR_Start),] # remove NA values

    # calculate UTR length for comparison
    fiveUTRLen <- abs(sum(focusUTR5[,3] - focusUTR5[,4])) + dim(focusUTR5)[1]

    # check 5' gene partner UTR (NOTE CHANGE 1 INDEX)
    if (as.numeric(newDescription[i,4]) > fiveUTRLen) {
        # breakpoint greater than UTR length
        nArray[i,1] <- TRUE # keep
    } else {
        # breakpoint less than UTR length
        nArray[i,1] <- FALSE # ignore
    }

    # get 3' gene partner, CDS length, and UTR information
    threeGeneIn2 <- newDescription[i,6] # get Ensembl ID for 3' gene
    focusGene3 <- ensemblData[ensemblData$Ensembl_Transcript_ID == threeGeneIn2,]

    # calculate CDS length
    cdsLen <- abs(sum(focusGene3$Exon_Chr_Start_bp -
                      focusGene3$Exon_Chr_End_bp)) + dim(focusGene3)[1]

    ## check CDS length vs gene breakpoint end lengths
    nArray[i,2] <- cdsLen == as.numeric(newDescription[i,8]) # end of 3' gene
    nArray[i,3] <- cdsLen - as.numeric(newDescription[i,8]) # get length diff

    # get breakpoint differences
    threeFuseLen <- abs(as.numeric(newDescription[i,8]) -
                    as.numeric(newDescription[i,7])) + 1
    focusUTR3 <- focusGene3[!is.na(focusGene3$X3_UTR_Start),] # remove NA values
    threeUTRLen <- abs(sum(focusUTR3$X3_UTR_Start -
                        focusUTR3$X3_UTR_End)) + dim(focusUTR3)[1]

    ## check 3' breakpoint
    if (threeFuseLen > threeUTRLen) {
        nArray[i,4] <- TRUE
    } else {
        nArray[i,4] <- FALSE
    }

    # change factors into numeric
    # as.numeric(levels(x$V7))[x$V7]
}
colnames(nArray) <- c("fivePrime", "threePrimeLength", "3EndDiff", "3EndBreak")
```

Load Functional Interaction Network Data
--------------------------------------------------------
```{r loadFI, cache=TRUE}
fi <- read.delim("../raw-data/FIsInGene_121013_with_annotations.txt")
dim(fi) # see how large file is
head(fi) # see what it looks like
```

Graph Analysis Plan
--------------------------------------------------------
Ultimately, we wish to do an analysis on the gene fusion itself. However, let us
first perform a graph analysis on the individual genes that are involved in the
gene fusions.

Three types of analyses will be performed on the genes:

- degree centrality - ranking the genes based on their degree
- closeness centrality - ranking genes based on distance between others
- betweenness centrality - rank genes based on their role 'between' others
- Google's Pagerank measures

After we perform an analysis on the individual genes, the plan is to perform an
anlysis on the fusions are a whole.

Extract Unique List of Genes in Fusions
--------------------------------------------------------
The unique gene pairs are in the matrix `allUniquePairs`. We need to get just the
unique genes that appear.

```{r uniqueGenes}
genesTF <- c(allUniquePairs[ ,1], allUniquePairs[ ,2]) # put genes in one array
allUniqueGenes <- genesTF[!duplicated(genesTF)] # get unique list
head(allUniqueGenes)
length(allUniqueGenes)
```

Interaction Network Exploration
--------------------------------------------------------
Let us see how many vertices and edges there exist in this network.

```{r graph}
library(igraph)

# put data in data frame so it can be put into graph data structure
fi_graph_df <- data.frame(
                    cbind(
                        as.character(fi[,1]), # first gene column
                        as.character(fi[,2]) # second gene column
                        )
                    )

fi_graph <- graph.data.frame(fi_graph_df)
vcount(fi_graph) # number of vertices in network
ecount(fi_graph) # number of edges in network

# analyze distribution of the degree of genes
geneDegrees <- degree(fi_graph)
logGeneDegrees <- log10(geneDegrees) # calculate log10-degree of genes
hist(logGeneDegrees,
     main = "Distribution of Gene Degrees",
     xlab = "Log10-Degree",
     ylab = "Frequency") # make histogram of degrees

# analyze closeness of genes

     main = "Histogram of Closeness in the Functional Interaction Network")
```

# focus on non-Fusion genes
otherGeneDegrees <- geneDegrees[setdiff(names(geneDegrees), allUniqueGenes)]
length(otherGeneDegrees)

# plot histograms of degree centralities of fusion genes and non-fusion genes
